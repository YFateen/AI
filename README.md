# Artificial-Intelligence 

Applied concepts include search problems (A*, CSP, minimax), reinforcement learning, bayes nets, and hidden markov models.


## Project 1 Search

Implemented Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search. Created different heuristics. Helped pacman agent find shortest path to eat all dots.

## Project 2 Multi-Agent Search

Created basic reflex agent based on a variety of parameters. Improved agent behavior by using minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning). Implemented expectimax for random ghost agents, and evaluation functions to maintain pacman states.

## Project 3 Reinforcement Learning

Worked with Markov Decision Processes. Started with value iteration agent, then worked on changing noise and discount parameters to enact different policies. Built Q-Learning agent and an Epsilon Greedy agent. Also used reinforcement learning to approximate Q-Values.

## Project 4 Bayes Nets

Implemented inference algorithms for Bayes Nets, specifically variable elimination and value-of-perfect-information computations, which reasons about the existence of invisible pellets and ghosts. The project includes constructing bayes nets, jointing factors, implementing variable elimination, normalization, marginal inference and value of perfect information.

## Project 5 Ghost Busters

Updated belief distribution of ghost agents and future agent states based on sequential noise readings. Moved pac-man based on closest likely ghost location. I then used particle filtering to achieve the same result. Finally, implemented joint particle filtering algorithm with multiple reactive ghosts.
