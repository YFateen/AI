# Artificial-Intelligence - Berkeley-CS188

Learned about search problems (A*, CSP, minimax), reinforcement learning, bayes nets, hidden markov models, and machine learning.


## Project 1 Search

Implemented Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search. Created different heuristics. Helped pacman agent find shortest path to eat all dots.

## Project 2 Multi-Agent Search

Created basic reflex agent based on a variety of parameters. Improved agent behavior by using minimax algorithm (with alpha-beta pruning). Implemented expectimax for random ghost agents, and evaluation functions to maintain pacman states.

## Project 3 Reinforcement Learning

Worked with Markov Decision Processes. Started with value iteration agent, then worked on changing noise and discount parameters to enact different policies. Built Q-Learning agent and an Epsilon Greedy agent. Also used reinforcement learning to approximate Q-Values.
